# Sonic Loader wake-from-rest auto-redeployer (Linux / macOS).

# Run this on a PC / NAS / router that's always on. It polls the PS5
# elfldr port every few seconds and re-sends sonic-loader.elf the
# moment the PS5 wakes from rest mode and the elfldr daemon is back.
#
# Usage:
#   PS5_IP=10.0.0.189 ./sonic-watchdog.sh /path/to/sonic-loader.elf
#
# Or set defaults inline. Ctrl-C to stop.
